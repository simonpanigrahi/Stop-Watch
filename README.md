# Stop-Watch
The repository is a simple stopwatch webpage that was created to practice JavaScript. The project was inspired by the recommendation of webdev friends to create a stopwatch as a way to improve JavaScript skills. It is a great way to learn how to implement basic functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
